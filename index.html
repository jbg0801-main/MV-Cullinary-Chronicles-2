        <p>here's a list of my favourite cuisines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Italian</li>
        </ol>
        <p>and here are some of my favourite foods:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="food-item">
                <img src="img/pasta.webp" alt="Pasta">
                <p>Pasta</p>
                <p>Pasta is a plain food coming in many different variants, great for covering in all sorts of toppings, sauces,
                    or combinations of the two. I have an unhealthy relationship with Pasta, living and dying by my unending consumption
                    of it. I'm a fan of adding cheese, tomato sauce, tuna, or a combination of the three.

            </div>
            <div class="food-item">
                <img src="img/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
                <p>Pizza</p>
                <p>Pizza is a classic, it's hard to hate. With endless possibilities found in toppings, and a simple base to build off,
                    there's pizza for everyone (unless you put pineapples on it you monster, then there's no pizza for you, only Hellmo.)
                    personally, I'm partial to a plain Margherita with Tuna on top.

                <img src="img/donuts.webp" alt="Donuts">
                <p>Donuts</p>
                <p>Donuts are great as an occasional treat, and come in many flavours, shapes and sizes,
                    which is most of what makes them appealing to me. I'm particularly partial to jam-filled
                    donuts, as well as basically any variant of donuts you can get at Lidl
